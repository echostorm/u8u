# u8u

**Next-gen AI-first workflow automation platform. 100% open-source.**

---

## 🚀 Why u8u?

[n8n](https://n8n.io) is a popular workflow automation tool—but its **"fair-code" license** limits full commercial freedom.

**u8u** is a fully reimagined, production-grade automation platform based on:

- ✅ **Truly open-source license** (MIT/Apache 2.0) – free for both commercial and personal use.
- 🧠 **AI-native architecture** – integrates seamlessly with modern AI tools using the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai).
- ⚙️ **Scalable by design** – powered by Docker, Next.js 15, and open integration standards.
